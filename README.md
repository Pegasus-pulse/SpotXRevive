# SpotXRevive

When I find out there is an update for Spotify, it's a pain to update Spotify by reinstalling it, then applying SpotX, and finally applying Spicetify. So I made this script to automate it.

### Usage
Simply download [this file](https://github.com/Pegasus-pulse/SpotXRevive/blob/main/SpotXRevive.bat) and run it.
